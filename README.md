# My React Native Learning Journey üöÄ

This repository documents my journey as I learn and explore React Native. It's a collection of small projects, practice exercises, and code snippets covering the fundamental concepts of mobile app development.

## üìå About This Repository

This repo isn't one single application but rather a "code sandbox" or "playground" containing multiple small projects. Each folder represents a specific topic, feature, or practice assignment.

## üìÅ Project Directory

Here's a breakdown of what you'll find in each folder:

* **`First_Code` / `Second` / `Third` / `Fourth`:**
    These likely contain my initial apps, starting from "Hello World" to more complex component structures.

* **`Props`:**
    Examples focused on understanding `props` (properties) and how to pass data from parent to child components.

* **`State and Hooks`:**
    Practice files for managing component state. This folder explores core React Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

* **`Conditions/Demo`:**
    Demonstrations of conditional rendering‚Äîhow to show or hide components using ternary operators (`? :`), `&&`, or `if` statements.

* **`Flat List/FlatList`:**
    Examples of how to render efficient, scrollable lists of data using the React Native `FlatList` component.

* **`router_ex`:**
    An exploration of navigation in a mobile app. This likely uses `React Navigation` to create stacks, tabs, and move between different screens.

* **`Weather_app`:**
    A small project-based app. It probably fetches data from a weather API and displays it in a clean mobile UI.

* **`Practice_3`:**
    Additional practice exercises, likely combining multiple concepts learned.

## üíª Technologies Used

* **React Native:** The core framework for building native mobile apps.
* **React:** The underlying library, including concepts like JSX, components, state, and props.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** The programming language used.
* **React Navigation** (likely): For handling app navigation and routing.
* **Expo** (possibly): A framework and platform for universal React applications, simplifying setup and development.

## üöÄ How to Run a Project

Since this repository contains many separate projects, you cannot run it from the root directory. To run a specific example:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/sakiv-rajput-2025/Your-Repo-Name.git](https://github.com/sakiv-rajput-2025/Your-Repo-Name.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate into a specific project folder:
    ```sh
    cd Your-Repo-Name/Weather_app
    ```
3.  Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    *(Or `yarn install` if you use Yarn)*

4.  Run the project:
    *If using **Expo**:*
    ```sh
    npx expo start
    ```
    *If using **React Native CLI**:*
    ```sh
    npx react-native run-android
    # or
    npx react-native run-ios
    ```
